# üì∞ Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect fake news articles based on textual content. The dataset consists of news articles labeled as **fake** or **real**, and various machine learning techniques, including **TF-IDF vectorization** and classification algorithms, are employed to classify the articles accurately. The project is structured in a clear and replicable manner, following an end-to-end data science workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## üìú Project Overview

In this project, we classify news articles as either **fake** or **real** based on their textual content. The dataset contains thousands of labeled articles, making it a suitable problem for text classification tasks. Our approach involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful features from the text and machine learning models to predict the authenticity of the news.

## üöÄ Approach Summary

Here is an overview of the approach taken in the project:

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
The raw text data is preprocessed to remove noise, standardize formatting, and prepare it for feature extraction. This includes:

- Lowercasing text
- Removing punctuation and numbers
- Eliminating stopwords
- Tokenization and stemming

### 2. **Feature Engineering**
We use **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** vectorization to convert textual data into numerical representations that machine learning models can understand.

### 3. **Modeling**
Several classification algorithms are explored, including:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**

Hyperparameter tuning is conducted to optimize performance.

### 4. **Evaluation**
The model is evaluated using standard metrics, including:

- **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness.
- **Precision & Recall**: To assess false positives and negatives.
- **F1-Score**: A balance between precision and recall.
